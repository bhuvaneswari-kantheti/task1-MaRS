I learned how to use Tinkercad and Arduino in the past week. I got to know about various kinds of sensors and their functions, and I have also explored more about how and where these sensors are used in real life. I have started learning how to write the codes required for Tinkercad circuit simulation.

Project 1 is made using a PIR sensor and a temperature sensor, which are used to detect motion of objects and temperature, respectively.
Project 2 is made using a Flex sensor and a force sensor, which are used to detect bending and measure mechanical force, respectively.
Project 3 is made using a potentiometer and an ambient light sensor, using which the light brightness is measured.
